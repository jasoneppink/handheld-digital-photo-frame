# Another Digital Photo Frame
There are a lot of really great open-source and DIY solutions for wall-mounted digital photo frames, most running [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) on Raspbery Pis. However, we wanted something that allows the user to hold the display and swipe through the photos, in addition to a standard passive slideshow mode. We were able to make one using off-the-shelf hardware and software for a total of $153.
